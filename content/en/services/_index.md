# The CIATA process
Do you want us to teach your team about specific AI topics? Or do you want us to build a custom solution for you? We can help you with both. 

At CIATA we follow a **structured approach** to ensure that we deliver **real business value**:

1. **Understanding your business**: We start by understanding your business and its challenges. We will work with you to identify the areas where AI can help you to grow your business.

2. **Data exploration**: Understanding the value of potential new products often involves analyzing existing data or predicting the impacts of new components in a workflow. We will work with you to understand the potential of your data and new AI-based products.

3. **Prototype development**: We focus on products with an artifical intelligence at their core. We will develop models and systems that are tailored to your business needs, based on most recent research and best practices. 

4. **Evaluation and explanations**: An important part of the CIATA package is a rigorous evaluation of the performance of the prototypes. We take pride in the scientific rigor of our work and we will ensure that our assessment is transparent, reproducible and representative of the production environment. An essential part of the evaluation is the explanation of the model. What exactly does the model do and why? What will it do if the inputs look different?

5. **Documentation**: You need to communicate the new AI-based products to your team, your clients and stakeholders. Everything we will do will be documented thoroughly for best reproducibility and understanding.

6. **Deployment**: AI systems often come with specific requirements to ensure scalable operation. We will help you to deploy the model and to integrate it into your business processes.

7. **Monitoring and maintenance**: The world often changes subtly and your AI models might find itself faced with unknown data. We will help you to monitor the performance of the model, detect data drifts and to ensure that it does what it was supposed to in the first place.

8. **Training and HR**: We can help you to train your team in developing your systems further. We offer workshops and training sessions that are tailored to your needs. After integrating a new AI system into your business, we can help you identify new hires that will help you to grow your AI capabilities.
